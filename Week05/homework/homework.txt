Homework: Shop inventory with files

Task:

Modify your Shop class to initialize the inventory dictionary using a
text file.

The file should contain a string representing the item's name, followed 
by an item price.
HINT: If you want to use multi-word strings for item names, check how to
use different characters as delimiters in strings' split() method.


HOMEWORK EXTENSION:
The program should output a log file, detailing the actions that the
user took while shopping.
Example log:
"User bought a(n) rusty sword for %100.00."
"User checked balance."
"User checked shop inventory."
"User tried to buy a(n) planetary ring for $1000000.00, but did not have
enough funds."
