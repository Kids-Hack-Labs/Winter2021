Activity 01:

Item shop:

Using a dictionary, create a shop with items to be sold to the user.
The items should have an associated price and the user should be able
to see a list of available items. The shop should offer at least five
items to sell to the customer.

The user should have a set amount of money at the beginning of the
program and use that money to buy the items from the shop. As long as
the user remains in the store, they are able to buy anything their
money allows, but the shop owner should let the customer know when
they are out of money to buy certain items. The user should also be
able to exit the shop at any time, causing the program to end.

Breakdown of needed functionality:
The shop: display and sell items.
User: Check items from the store, buy items, check their own balance.

Extension 01: Have the user be its own dictionary and keep track of how
    many items they have bought.

Extension 02: Use the pprint library to pretty-print the shop's
    inventory, or create your own way of pretty-printing it.

Extension 03: Allow the user to add items to the shop if they are not
    yet available. In this case, the user should also be prompted for
    the item's cost

Extension 04: Organize your code in functions to streamline and 
    de-clutter the main function
