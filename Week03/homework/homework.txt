Homework: Supply Run

Using a dictionary, create a shop to keep track of an inventory.
The user should be able to add and remove items from the shop and print
a stock of the available items.

Each item should be organized as an item in the shop dictionary as
follows:

Key: Item name (string)
Value: List with three items: description (string), price(float) and
amount(int)

The shop should have a starting menu with four options: "supply",
"check", "retrieve" and "leave"

When the user begins the program, they are greeted by the shop owner,
and are asked what action  they want to perform.

If the user chooses to supply items, they must be asked for the item's
name. If there are already items with that name in stock, the amount
available in the shop must be updated accordingly. If it is a new item,
the user should be prompted to provide an item description as well as a
price for it and an amount to be put in the shop.

If the user chooses to retrieve an item, they will also be asked for
the item's name. If there is no such item in the inventory, the program
must tell the user that the item doesn't exist. If the item retrieval
leaves the shop with none of that item, the item should be taken out of
the shop's catalogue.

If the user chooses to check the shop's inventory, print ONLY the 
items' names and the amount available.

If the user chooses to leave the shop, print a farewell message and
exit the program
