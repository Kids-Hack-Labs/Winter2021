Activity: Creating a number guessing game

Steps:

import the random module

create the application main entry point:
    seed the random number generator
    get a random number between 1 and 100, put it in a variable
    create a variable to store the number of guesses the player will
        be allowed
    create a variable to control if the game is still being played,
        set it to True
    create a variable to control if the game is won, set it to False

    while the game is being played:
        get a guess from the user. Remember to convert it into an
	    integer
	subtract one try from the total tries of the user

        if the answer matches the target:
	    set the won variable to True
	    set the "game is being played" variable to False
	otherwise:
	    let the user know that their number is wrong.

        if there are no tries left:
	    set the "game is being played" variable to False

    if the player won the game:
        congratulate the player using a message
    otherwise:
        let the player know they ran out of tries

(create the driver code:)
if the __name__ attribute of the module is "__main__":
    call the application main entry point
