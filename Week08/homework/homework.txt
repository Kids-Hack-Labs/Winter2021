Homework: Rendering multiple pieces of text

Task:
Using the other indices in the scene_text argument passed as part of
the Scene's initializer, render the text they contain on the screen.

Breakdown of the task:
In the Scene class's initializer, the argument passed with the name
scene_text is actually a list of strings with seven items. All items
can be rendered to the screen as text. Using the first element (built
in class) as an example, create surfaces for the other six elements in
the initializer. Remember to get their rects. Next, in the render() 
method, position these elements and blit them on the screen. Test your
code by running the quiz.py file.
