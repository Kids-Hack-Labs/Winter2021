Activity 2: Working with JSON

Task:
Convert Wee 04's shop activity to read the inventory from a JSON file.

Task breakdown:
Remember to import the json module at the beginning of your code file.

Using Week 04's activity, change the Shop class to take a file object
in its constructor. The inventory attribute should be set by reading 
the JSON-formatted string from the file. This means that the dictionary
that stores the Shop's inventory needs to be taken out from the file
and stored in a .json file.

The main() function should open the file and pass a file object to the 
Shop's constructor. As a safety measure, try to code it so that the 
file is closed after the Shop object construction and before the rest
of the code actually runs.

As a test, try adding/modifying items to the .json file and then 
calling the main() function again directly from the shell. If 
everything worked out right, you just changed the contents of your shop
without changing a single line of code. Also, notice that format 
conversion is done automatically: you don't have to worry about casting
strings into numbers for the prices, as the json module does that for 
you

EXTENSION:
Allow the user to add items to the shop (use Week 04's extensions) and 
have the program save the shop's inventory back in the .json file. From
this point on, you should be able to open and modify the inventory
dictionary without changing the code.
