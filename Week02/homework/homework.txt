Homework: Zodiac sign calculator

Objective: Create a program where the user inputs their name and date of
           birth, and the program outputs the person's zodiac sign.

Example input:
    Name: "John Doe"
    Day of Birth: 10
    Month of Birth: "July"
    
Example output:
    "John Doe was born in May 10, so they are a(n) Gemini"

Create the application main entry point:
    Create a list or tuple to store the names of the months in string
    format. (Ex.: "January", "February"...)
    The second container should have the day when the sign changes,
    according to the month. (Ex.: The sign changes from Capricorn to
                             Aquarius in Jan. 20, so the first item in
                             the day list should be 20)
    The third list should contain the names of the zodiac signs.

    For reference, the zodiac signs dates are listed as below:
    (You can use other sources. Note that dates can vary slightly)

    Aries: March 21 to April 20
    Taurus: April 21 to May 21
    Gemini: May 22 to June 22
    Cancer: June 23 to July 22
    Leo: July 23 to August 22
    Virgo: August 23 to September 22
    Libra: September 23 to October 22
    Scorpio: October 23 to November 21
    Sagittarius: November 22 to December 22
    Capricorn: December 23 to January 21
    Aquarius: January 22 to February 20
    Pisces: February 21 to March 19
    
    Get input from the user for the person's name, day of birth and
    month of birth

    Using the input from the user, output their zodiac sign

Challenge: Work the program into a loop and keep asking the user for
           names and dates and months, outputting their signs until
           the user decides to quit. (HINT: use last week's homework
           as a basis for this challenge)
