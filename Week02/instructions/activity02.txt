Activity 02: Lists and Tuples

Using the previous activity as a basis, store all the information in a
    single tuple.

Change the f-string to use the appropriate values from the tuple.

Try to change the tuple with new information provided by the user.
    Notice that this produces an error

Change the tuple into a list. Modify the information again and display
    it on the screen

Try adding information to the list. Use a for loop to print each item
    in the list separately
