Activity 01: Strings

Create five variables to store: first name, last name, day, month, and
    year of birth.

Using a single f-string, create a variable that includes that info.

Print the message string to the shell.
    Example: "John Doe was born in May 31, 1983"


Prompt the user to input their own information in the variables created
    before

Print the same message and notice how the values do not change. Print
    the variables separately and notice how the changes were saved. To
    change the values in the message, the message variable must be
    rewritten.

Create a function that rewrites the message so that it prints correctly
    when the user inputs new values.

Challenge: Rewrite the activity to include a loop where the user is
    prompted to input different information for different people, and
    have the message change every time the information variables are
    updated. Allow the user to stop inputting information by offering
    an option to stop providing information after the message is
    printed to the console
